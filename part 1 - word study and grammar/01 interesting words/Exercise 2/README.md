## Exercise 2

The days of the week and the months of the year are interesting in their derivation. Monday, for example, represents the day sacred to the Moon as a deity. Explain the origin of each of the following:

(Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December)


### Days of the Week

- Sunday comes from the Old English Sunnandæg, meaning “Day of the Sun.” It was named in honor of the Sun, which was worshiped as a god in many ancient cultures.

- Monday means “Day of the Moon.” It comes from the Old English Monandæg and refers to the Moon, once considered a divine being.

- Tuesday originates from Old English Tiwesdæg, named after Tiw (or Tyr), the Norse god of war. It corresponds to the Roman god Mars, so it’s essentially “Mars’ Day.”

- Wednesday comes from Old English Wodnesdæg, meaning “Woden’s Day,” named after Woden (or Odin), the chief Norse god. The Roman equivalent is Mercury’s Day.

- Thursday means “Thor’s Day,” from Old English Þunresdæg. Thor was the Norse god of thunder, corresponding to the Roman god Jupiter.

- Friday comes from Old English Frīgedæg, meaning “Frigg’s Day,” named after Frigg or Freya, the Norse goddess of love and beauty — the counterpart of Venus.

- Saturday is from Latin Saturni dies, meaning “Day of Saturn.” It honors Saturn, the Roman god of agriculture. It’s the only day of the week that still keeps its Roman name in English.

### Months of the Year

- January is named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and doorways, symbolizing transitions and new starts.

- February comes from Februa, a Roman festival of purification held during this month, hence the meaning “purification.”

- March is named after Mars, the Roman god of war. It was the first month of the early Roman year, marking the start of the military season.

- April likely comes from the Latin aperire, meaning “to open,” referring to the opening of buds and flowers in spring.

- May is named for Maia, a Roman goddess associated with growth and fertility.

- June honors Juno, the queen of the Roman gods and goddess of marriage and women.

- July was originally called Quintilis, meaning the fifth month in the old Roman calendar. It was renamed in honor of Julius Caesar after his death.

- August was originally Sextilis, the sixth month. It was renamed for Emperor Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to honor his achievements.

- September comes from septem, Latin for “seven,” since it was the seventh month in the early Roman year.

- October comes from octo, meaning “eight,” since it was the eighth month before January and February were added to the calendar.

- November comes from novem, Latin for “nine.” It was the ninth month of the old Roman year.

- December comes from decem, Latin for “ten.” It was the tenth month in the early Roman calendar.
