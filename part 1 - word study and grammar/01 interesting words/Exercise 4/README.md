## Exercise 4

Explain the origin of each of the following:
(curfew, pompadour, hyacinth, dandelion, dahlia, begonia, tulip, aster, dunce, humor, villain, echo, turquoise, amethyst, tantalize, umbrella, sandwich, lunatic, good-bye, dismal, titanic, volcano, tangle, babble)

#### 1. Curfew

From Old French couvre-feu, meaning “cover fire.” In medieval times, a bell was rung at evening to remind people to cover or put out their fires — hence curfew came to mean a set time when people must be indoors.



#### 2. Tulip

From Turkish tülbend, meaning “turban.” The flower was thought to resemble the shape of a turban; Europeans changed the word to tulipan and later tulip.


#### 3. Turquoise

From French turquoise, meaning “Turkish (stone).” The gemstone was first brought to Europe from Turkey — hence the name turquoise.



#### 4. Good-bye

Shortened from God be with ye (or God be by ye). Over time, the phrase was slurred and contracted into good-bye.



#### 5. Pompadour

Named after Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), mistress of King Louis XV of France, who popularized the elaborate hairstyle that now bears her name.



#### 6. Aster

From Greek astēr, meaning “star.” The flower was named for its star-like shape.



#### 7. Amethyst

From Greek amethystos, meaning “not drunken,” from a- (“not”) + methystos (“intoxicated”). The ancient Greeks believed the purple gem prevented drunkenness.



#### 8. Dismal

From Latin dies mali, meaning “evil days.” The phrase originally referred to certain unlucky days in medieval calendars — later it came to mean gloomy or depressing.



#### 9. Hyacinth

From Greek mythology — Hyacinthus was a beautiful youth accidentally killed by Apollo, who caused a flower to spring from his blood. The plant was named in his memory.



#### 10. Dunce

From John Duns Scotus (1265–1308), a Scottish scholar whose followers were later mocked for being slow or old-fashioned in learning. Thus, dunce came to mean a slow learner.



#### 11. Tantalize

From Tantalus, a figure in Greek mythology condemned to stand in water that receded when he tried to drink and beneath fruit that moved away when he reached for it. Hence, tantalize means to tease with something desirable but out of reach.



#### 12. Titanic

From the Titans, a race of powerful giants in Greek mythology. Titanic came to mean enormous in strength, size, or power.



#### 13. Dandelion

From French dent-de-lion, meaning “lion’s tooth,” referring to the toothed edges of its leaves.



#### 14. Humor

From Latin umor (or humor), meaning “moisture.” Ancient physicians believed human temperament depended on four bodily fluids or “humors.” Later, humor came to mean mood or temperament, and eventually the quality of being funny.



#### 15. Umbrella

From Latin umbra, meaning “shade” or “shadow.” An umbrella was originally a device for providing shade from the sun — later used for protection from rain.



#### 16. Volcano

From Vulcanus (Vulcan), the Roman god of fire. The word was first applied to Mount Etna and other fiery mountains believed to be his workshop.



#### 17. Dahlia

Named after Anders Dahl (1751–1789), a Swedish botanist. The flower was named in his honor.



#### 18. Villain

From Latin villanus, meaning “farm servant,” from villa (“country house” or “farm”). In medieval times, country workers were considered rough or uncouth — the term evolved to mean an evil or wicked person.



#### 19. Sandwich

Named after John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich (1718–1792), who is said to have eaten slices of meat between bread so he could continue playing cards without stopping for a meal.



#### 20. Tangle

From Middle English tanglen, related to Old Norse tangl (“seaweed” or “snare”). It came to mean to twist or entwine in confusion.



#### 21. Begonia

Named after Michel Bégon, a French governor of Santo Domingo and a patron of botany. The flower was named in his honor.



#### 22. Echo

From Echo, a nymph in Greek mythology who could only repeat the words of others as punishment for offending Hera. The word came to mean a repeated sound.



#### 23. Lunatic

From Latin lunaticus, meaning “moonstruck,” from luna (“moon”). It was once believed that the phases of the moon affected people’s sanity.



#### 24. Babble

From Middle English babelen, imitating the sound of people talking incoherently or of a baby trying to speak. The word is onomatopoeic, imitating the sound it describes.
