## Exercise 3

Look up the derivation of the following:
(cancel, pecuniary, cheat, speculation, phaëton, bead, paper, book, bayonet, tawdry, ambition, influence, virtue, peevish, disaster, hospital, pavilion, mackintosh,
 chapel, omnibus)

 #### 1. Cancel

From Latin cancellāre, meaning “to make like a lattice,” from cancelli (“crossbars”). In Roman times, writing was crossed out with lattice-like lines — hence the meaning “to strike out” or “annul.”



#### 2. Bead

From Old English bede, meaning “prayer.” People used strings of small balls to count prayers — over time, the word for the prayers (bede) came to mean the objects used to count them.



#### 3. Ambition

From Latin ambitio, meaning “a going around,” from ambire (“to go around”). In ancient Rome, candidates went around soliciting votes — hence “ambition” came to mean a strong desire for success or power.



#### 4. Hospital

From Latin hospes (“guest” or “host”) and hospitālis (“of a guest”). Originally meant a place for guests or travelers — later a place for the sick or needy to receive care.



#### 5. Pecuniary

From Latin pecunia (“money”), which came from pecus (“cattle”). In early societies, wealth was measured by ownership of cattle — hence pecuniary came to mean relating to money.



#### 6. Paper

From Latin papyrus, a writing material made from the papyrus plant of Egypt. The name passed into Old French papier, and later English paper.



#### 7. Influence

From Latin influentia, meaning “a flowing in.” In medieval astrology, it referred to the supposed flow of power from the stars influencing human affairs — later used generally to mean the power to affect others.



#### 8. Pavilion

From Latin papilio, meaning “butterfly” or “tent.” The word referred to the shape of a tent’s canvas wings — later used for any light, decorative building or shelter.



#### 9. Cheat

From the Old English word escheat, a legal term meaning “property reverting to the state or lord when there is no heir.” It came to mean “to take something unfairly” or “to defraud.”



#### 10. Book

From Old English bōc, related to bēce (“beech tree”). Early writing tablets were made of thin pieces of beech wood — hence the word book.


#### 11. Virtue

From Latin virtus, meaning “manliness” or “courage,” from vir (“man”). Later it came to mean moral excellence or goodness.


#### 12. Mackintosh

Named after Charles Macintosh (1766–1843), a Scottish chemist who invented waterproof fabric made by coating cloth with rubber. The raincoat made from it was called a mackintosh.



#### 13. Speculation

From Latin speculatio (“watching, observing”), from speculari (“to look at, watch”). Originally meant careful observation; later came to mean forming opinions or financial risks based on uncertain evidence.



#### 14. Bayonet

Named after the town of Bayonne in France, where it is said to have been first made. The word came to mean the blade attached to the muzzle of a rifle.



#### 15. Peevish

From Middle English peevysh, possibly related to peev, meaning “silly” or “perverse.” It came to mean cross, irritable, or ill-tempered.



#### 16. Chapel

From Latin capella (“little cape”). The relic of St. Martin’s cloak (cappa) was kept in a small shrine — capella — and the priests who guarded it were called chaplains. Hence, chapel came to mean a small church.



#### 17. Phaëton

From Phaëthon, son of the sun god Helios in Greek mythology, who attempted to drive his father’s chariot across the sky and lost control. The word was later used for a light, open carriage drawn by horses — suggesting speed and recklessness.



#### 18. Tawdry

From Saint Audrey’s lace (sold at fairs in honor of St. Audrey). Over time, Saint Audrey’s was shortened to tawdry and came to mean cheap and showy.



#### 19. Disaster

From Italian disastro, from Greek dus- (“bad”) + astron (“star”). Originally meant a bad star — based on the belief that stars influenced human fate — now it means a great misfortune.



#### 20. Omnibus

From Latin omnibus, meaning “for all.” It was first used in France for a horse-drawn carriage that carried many passengers — hence the name for a bus.
