### **Rule 3**
Compound nouns usually add the sign of the plural to the **fundamental part** of the word.

> **Note:** In *spoonfuls* the thought is of one spoon many times full.

## **Plural of Letters and Figures**

### **Rule 4**
Letters and figures form the plural by adding the **apostrophe (') and s**; as,

- a → a’s  
- w → w’s  
- 3 → 3’s  
- 5 → 5’s  

The same rule applies to the plural of words that ordinarily have no plural; as,

> Don’t use so many *and’s* and *if’s*.
