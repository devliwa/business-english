# Exercise 36 — The Formation of Participles

**Rap, rapping, rapped**  **Reap, reaping, reaped**

**Rule:**  
*Rap* is a monosyllable ending in a single consonant preceded by a single vowel.  
The final consonant in such words is **doubled** before a suffix beginning with a vowel is added.  

In *reap*, the final consonant is **not doubled** because it is preceded by **two vowels**.

### Make the participles of the following verbs:

chat lap suit step  
cheat leap sit steep  
rot train sop trot  
root trim soap treat  

---

**Trap, trapping, trapped**  **Track, tracking, tracked**

**Question:** Why is the final consonant in *trap* doubled before *ing* or *ed* is added?  
**Answer:** Because *trap* ends in a **single consonant preceded by a single vowel**.  

The final consonant in *track* is **not doubled** because *track* ends with **two consonants**.

---

**Pin, pinning**  **Pine, pining**

**Rule:**  
*Pine* drops the silent **e** because the tendency in English is to **drop endings that are not needed for pronunciation** before adding a suffix beginning with a vowel.
