# Exercise 37 — The Formation of Participles (Continued)

**Rule:**  
Exercise 36 applies also to words of more than one syllable **accented on the last syllable**, if they retain the accent on the same syllable after the suffix is added.  

**Rule 5:**  
Monosyllables or words accented on the last syllable, **ending in a single consonant preceded by a single vowel**, double the final consonant before adding a suffix beginning with a vowel.

---

### Form participles from the following words that are accented on the last syllable:

prefer intervene escape expel  
refer reveal acquire contain  
occur repeal secure forbid  
permit pursue conceal incur  
interfere erase arrange forget  
retain control acquit repel  

---

### Form participles from the following words **not accented on the last syllable**:

benefit travel marvel shelter  
revel answer exhibit render  
quarrel profit shovel limit  

---

### Note:
Words in which the accent **changes** do **not double** the final consonant before adding a suffix beginning with a vowel; as,

confer → conference  
infer → inference  
refer → reference  
prefer → preferable  

---

### Explain why the final consonant is **not doubled** in each of the following words:

neglect → neglecting  
lean → leaning  
prefer → preference  
select → selecting  
creep → creeping  
receipt → receipting  
wonder → wondering  
answer → answering
