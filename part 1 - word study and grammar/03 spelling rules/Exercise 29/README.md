## Notes and Questions

1. **Usual Plural Formation**  
   The usual way of forming the plural of English nouns is illustrated by the words in column (b): **add -s**.  

2. **Pronunciation Distinction**  
   - If you add **-s** to the singular **dress**, could you distinguish the plural from the singular?  
   - This suggests a reason for adding **-es** to form the plural.  

3. **Syllable Consideration**  
   - How many syllables must you use to pronounce the plural of **fox**?  
   - This suggests another reason for adding **-es** to form the plural.  

4. **Rule for Sibilant/ Hissing Sounds**  
   - Every word that ends in a **sibilant or hissing sound** (ch, s, sh, ss, x, z) forms its plural like **fox**.  
   - **Examples:** bush → bushes, class → classes, buzz → buzzes, box → boxes, match → matches

## Rule 1
