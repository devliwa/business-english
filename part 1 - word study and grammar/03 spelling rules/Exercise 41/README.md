# Exercise 41 — Words Ending in Silent *e*

Words ending in silent **e**, according to **Rule 5**, drop the **e** before a suffix beginning with a vowel.  
Exceptions occur when the **e** is needed to preserve the soft sound of **c** and **g**.  

Explain why **e** is dropped in *encouraging* and retained in *courageous*.

---

In words containing **dg**, as in *judge* and *lodge*, the **d** gives the **g** the soft sound, and there is no need to retain the **e** before adding a suffix, as in *judgment*.

---

### Rule 9
> Words ending in silent **e** usually drop the **e** before adding a suffix beginning with a vowel, **unless the e is needed to preserve the pronunciation** — as after soft **c** and **g**, when the suffix begins with **a** or **o**.

---

### Retain the **e** before the suffix in:
- noticeable  
- damageable  
- pronounceable  
- outrageous  
- courageous  
- peaceable  
- serviceable  
- manageable  

---

### Drop the **e** before adding the suffix in:
- managing  
- curable  
- erasure  
- besieging  
- admirable  
- realization  
- receiving  
- obliging  
- precedence  
- perseverance

### Note
The fact that **c** has two different sounds causes a slight peculiarity in words ending in **c**.  
Final **c** has the sound of **k**. When words end in **c**, the letter **k** is usually added before a suffix beginning with **e**, **i**, or **y**, to show that **c** is not pronounced like **s**; as,

- frolic → frolicked → frolicking

If the **k** is not added, the **c** changes its pronunciation; as,

- public → publicity
