### **Dual Plurals**

Some words admit of **two plurals** — one being the foreign plural, and the other the regular English plural; as,

| **Singular** | **Plural (Foreign)** | **Plural (English)** |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| beau          | beaux                | beaus                 |
| formula       | formulae              | formulas              |
| vertex        | vertices              | vertexes              |
| index         | indices               | indexes               |
| cherub        | cherubim              | cherubs               |
| seraph        | seraphim              | seraphs               |
| bandit        | banditti              | bandits               |

Consult a dictionary to see whether there is any **difference of meaning** between the two plurals of these words.
