## Exercise 10 — Diacritical Marks

Although an **a** is always written **a**, it is not always given the same quality or length of sound.  
When we discover a new word, it is important that we know exactly the quality to give each of the vowels in it.  
For this purpose, **diacritical marks** have been invented.  
They are illustrated in the following list from *Webster’s International Dictionary.*

> **Note:** Due to display limitations, `[+x]` is used to denote a letter with a tack above it.
