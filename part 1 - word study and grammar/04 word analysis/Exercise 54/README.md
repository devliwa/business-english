# Exercise 54 â€” Peculiar Adjective Endings

The suffixes **-able** and **-ible** are sometimes troublesome because it is difficult to know which ending to write.  

- **Rule:** If the new word was made from another English word, the ending is **-able**, e.g., *blamable*.  
- Words ending in **-ible** are derived from Latin, and the ending usually cannot be separated from the root and still leave the latter an English word.  

**Examples:**

| -ible | -able |
|-------|-------|
| divisible | intelligible |
| digestible | audible |
| visible | permissible |
| flexible | incredible |
| possible | terrible |
| horrible | indelible |

The suffixes **-ant** and **-ent** must also be carefully noted. No strict rule exists for choosing one over the other. Consult a dictionary when in doubt.  

**Examples:**

| -ant | -ent |
|------|------|
| important | independent |
| pleasant | convalescent |
| triumphant | competent |
| luxuriant | convenient |
| stagnant | confident |
