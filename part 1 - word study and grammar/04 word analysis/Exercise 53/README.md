# Exercise 53 â€” Assimilation of Prefixes

When the prefixes **ad**, **con**, and **in** are used to form English words, the final consonant of each is often changed to match the initial consonant of the root to which it is joined.

---

## 1. Prefix **ad**
Ad assumes the forms **ab, ac, af, ag, al, an, ap, ar, as, at**, assimilating the **d** with the first letter of the word to which it is prefixed. Examples:

| Form | Example Word |
|------|--------------|
| ab   | ab-breviate  |
| ac   | ac-cept      |
| ac   | ac-cumulate  |
| af   | af-fect      |
| af   | af-flict     |
| ag   | ag-gregate   |
| al   | al-literation|
| an   | an-nex       |
| an   | an-nounce    |
| ap   | ap-position  |
| ar   | ar-rest      |
| as   | as-sign      |
| as   | as-sist      |
| at   | at-tract     |
| at   | at-tribute   |
| at   | at-tune      |

## 2. Prefix **con**
Con assumes the forms **col, cor, com**, by assimilation; it takes the form **com** before **p**; and it drops the **n** before a vowel. Examples:

| Form | Example Word |
|------|--------------|
| col  | col-lateral  |
| col  | col-lect     |
| com  | com-mercial  |
| com  | com-pose     |
| com  | com-mission  |
| cor  | cor-relate   |
| cor  | cor-respond  |
| co   | co-operate   |
| co   | co-ordinate  |

## 3. Prefix **in**
In assumes the forms **il, im, ir**, by assimilation and takes the form **im** before **p**. Examples:

| Form | Example Word |
|------|--------------|
| il   | il-lusion    |
| im   | im-migrate   |
| im   | im-port      |
| ir   | ir-ruption   |
