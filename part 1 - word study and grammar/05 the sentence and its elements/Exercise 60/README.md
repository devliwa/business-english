# Exercise 60 — Sentence Errors

## S.1. The Baby Blunder

One of the most elementary forms of correctness in writing is the **proper division into sentences**. The ability to instinctively end a sentence at the right place is called the **sentence sense**.

Students who lack this ability or who have not learned the difference between sentences, subordinate clauses, and phrases frequently make the mistake of **setting off too much or too little for one sentence**.

### Example of Error: Two sentences run together

**Wrong:**  
Motor wagons are economical, department stores of all large cities are acquiring them.

**Explanation:**  
- "Motor wagons are economical" → principal clause  
- "Department stores of all large cities are acquiring them" → principal clause  
- Two principal clauses **cannot stand in the same sentence separated only by a comma**.  
- This error is called a **comma fault** or **baby blunder** (S 1).

**Corrected Versions:**  
- Using two sentences:  
  Motor wagons are economical. Department stores of all large cities are acquiring them.  
- Using a comma + coordinate conjunction:  
  Motor wagons are economical, and department stores of all large cities are acquiring them.  
- Using a semicolon:  
  Motor wagons are economical; department stores of all large cities are acquiring them.

### Special Note on Conjunctive Adverbs

Conjunctive adverbs such as:  
`so, then, therefore, thus, also, still, otherwise, however, hence, consequently, moreover, nevertheless`  

**Cannot** join two principal clauses with only a comma. Use either a **semicolon** or a **comma + coordinate conjunction**.

**Wrong:**  
He had been a good customer, so they were sorry to lose his trade.

**Correct:**  
- He had been a good customer; so they were sorry to lose his trade.  
- He had been a good customer, and so they were sorry to lose his trade.

## S.2. Using too little (Subordinate Clause or Phrase as a Sentence)

- **S 1:** Too much for one sentence  
- **S 2:** Too little for one sentence

### Examples

**1. Wrong:**  
I told her I would attend to the matter at my earliest convenience.  
Probably on my way from work in the evening.

**2. Wrong:**  
His doctor advised him to go to Arizona.  
Which he decided to do.

**Explanation:**  
- The second parts in each example (`Probably on my way...` and `Which he decided...`) are **subordinate clauses or phrases** and **cannot stand alone as complete sentences**.  

**Correction:**  
- Combine into one sentence or attach to the previous sentence properly.
