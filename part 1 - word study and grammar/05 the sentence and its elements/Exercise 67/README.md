# Exercise 67 — Prepositions vs. Adverbs

**Instructions:** Identify whether the italicized word is a **preposition** or an **adverb**.  
A **preposition** always begins a phrase and is followed by an object.  
An **adverb** modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb and usually answers: how? when? where? why?

| Sentence | Word | Part of Speech | Explanation |
|----------|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | in | Preposition | "in the office" — introduces a prepositional phrase with object "office" |
| 2 | in | Adverb | "came in this evening" — modifies the verb "came", no object follows |
| 3 | on | Preposition | "his coat on" — indicates location, part of the phrase "on his coat" |
| 4 | over | Preposition | "over his arm" — introduces a phrase with object "arm" |
| 5 | on | Preposition | "on the top step" — prepositional phrase indicating location |
| 6 | off | Adverb | "fell off" — modifies verb "fell", no object immediately follows |
| 6 | off | Preposition | "off the shelf" — introduces phrase with object "shelf" |
| 7 | over | Preposition | "over the city" — prepositional phrase with object "city" |
| 8 | over | Adverb | "going over" — modifies verb "going", direction implied, no object immediately |
