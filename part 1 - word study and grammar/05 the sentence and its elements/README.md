# Chapter V: The Sentence and Its Elements

In the preceding chapters, we have studied words individually—their pronunciation and how they were formed to express meaning. In this chapter, we begin a **review of grammar**, focusing on words **according to their use** as they are arranged to express complete ideas.

The simplest group of words arranged to express a complete idea is the **sentence**, consisting of two important parts:

| Subject | Predicate       |
|---------|----------------|
| The sun | shines brightly |

- **Subject**: The part about which something is told.  
- **Predicate**: The part that tells something about the subject.

## Kinds of Sentences (By Meaning)

1. **Declarative sentence** – States a fact.  
   *Example:* John closed the door.

2. **Interrogative sentence** – Asks a question.  
   *Example:* Did John close the door?

3. **Imperative sentence** – Commands or entreats.  
   *Example:* Close the door.

4. **Exclamatory sentence** – Expresses deep feeling.  
   *Example:* What a noise the door made!

## Sentences (By Structure)

Sentences are also classified according to **form or structure**:

- **Simple sentence**: Contains one subject and one predicate (one principal clause).  
  *Example:* To-day most of the world's big questions are business questions.

- **Compound sentence**: Made up of two or more independent parts (principal clauses).  
  *Example:* Many people still belittle business, calling it humdrum routine and sordid money-making, but this view needs revising.

- **Complex sentence**: Contains one principal clause and one or more subordinate clauses.  
  *Example:* The view that business is only humdrum routine and sordid money-making needs revising, since most of the world's big questions are business questions.

## Phrases and Clauses

- **Phrase**: A group of related words used as a part of speech (noun, adjective, or adverb) but **does not contain a subject or predicate**.  
  *Examples:*  
  1. of the world's big questions  
  2. calling it humdrum routine and sordid money-making

- **Clause**: A group of words containing a subject and a predicate.  
  - **Subordinate clause**: A dependent clause used as a part of speech. Often has an **introductory word** distinguishing it from a principal clause.  
    *Examples:*  
    1. that business is only humdrum routine and sordid money-making  
    2. since most of the world's big questions are business questions
